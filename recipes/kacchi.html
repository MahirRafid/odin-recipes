    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 kg mutton (the meat should not be from very young or too aged goat)</li>
        <li>2 cups ghee</li>
        <li>1 kg basmati rice (you can use miniature rice as well, but basmati rice will give a special flavor and look longer than usual size of rice)</li>
        <li>2 cups yogurt</li>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>1 cup cooking oil</li>
        <li> teaspoons hot spices powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons cumin powder</li>
        <li>10 pieces of dried Alu Bokhara (prune) etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Chop mutton about 150 gm size each with a good quality of the sharp knife. Clean the mutton pieces and drain out water. Marinate mutton for 2-3 hours mixing with all spices less than 50% ghee and except onion and milk.</li>
        <li>Fry potatoes lightly in oil and keep them separately. Then fry onion slices till they turn to brown color. Half cook rice and then keep on a strainer to drain out water.</li>
        <li>Take a big deep and heavy pan. It would be non-stick or aluminum or stainless steel. You can check the store and online for the best saucepan. After marinating the mutton, add milk on and then spread rice and half-fried potato over the mutton. Spread fried onion, rest of the ghee, dried prune, raisin, and kewra water one over the other. Cover the pan with a lid and seal it (You can use flour dough for sealing).</li>
        <li>Keep on the burner on low beam for about an hour. You will get the scent of kacchi biryani once the cooking of kacchi biryani is over. Open the lid and mix gently and again cover the lid.</li>
        <li>Take to the serving dish at the time of the meal to serve the mutton kacchi biryani hot and with flavor.</li>
