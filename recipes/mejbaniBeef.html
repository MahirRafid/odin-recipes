    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Kg of Beef (with bones and fat)</li>
        <li>1 cup Chopped Onion</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon Hot spices</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Almond Paste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Fennel Powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Mustard Paste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Ginger-Garlic Paste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Fenugreek Paste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Poppy Seed Paste</li>
        <li> tablespoons Cumin Powder etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add all the spices one by one. First add with cumin powder. Then add poppy seed paste, Ginger-Garlic paste, Fenugreek paste, white Mustard, Fennel powder, Almond paste, Hot spices, Turmeric, Chilli,veresta and salt one by one. Use the rest of the spices while cooking. Now rub the mixer well by hand so that the spices stick well to the beef. If the spices are not good on the meat, the test will not be good. After mashing, the meat is marinated.</li>
        <li>Now put a pan in the oven and heat 1/2 cup of oil. Add hot spices. Fry well until it has a nice flavor. Add onion chops. After frying for 2 minutes, add the meats and stir well. Add a small amount of water and stir well again. Cover until water comes out of the meat. It will take about 5/6 minutes for the water to come out. Keep the stove on high heat in this condition</li>
        <li>After 5 minutes:
            Water has come out of the meat. Now stir again. Then cover until the oil comes out of the meat. It will take about 7/8 minutes for the oil to come out. Occasionally come and stir.</li>
        <li>After 7/8 minutes:
            The oil has come out of the meat. Now stir after adding the chopped tomatoes. Stir again with 1 glass of water. Cover and cook on medium heat for 45 to 50 minutes. Occasionally add water and stir it.One thing to keep in mind at all times is that it takes a lot of spice to cook Mejbani meat. Try to keep the spice items right, then the original test will come.</li>
        <li>Take a look after 50 minutes. The original Mejbani curry will get a nice flavor and color. The meat will be cooked. Then take out the dish for serving. The Mejbani Beef is very tasty and special. You can understand by looking. Can't imagine how delicious it will be.</li>
